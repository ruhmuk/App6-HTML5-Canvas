Brief Description of Goal of Code:
The goal of this code is to create a canvas on the home page of our app, and with different buttons, display various things on the canvas. This is a good foundation for when we create diagnostic apps that display, intake and evaluate pictures.
 
Known Issues:
I am not sure how exactly to put the buttons directly below the canvas, as right now they are moreso next to the canvas. Furthermore, the buttons all layer the various images/shapes/text on top of one another, and I am not sure if I am supposed to clear the canvas before each element is displayed.
However, the user can press reset before displaying the other elements on the canvas.
